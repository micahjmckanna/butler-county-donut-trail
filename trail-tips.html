      <h3 class="tip-list__heading">Grab a Passport</h3>
      <p>You can download your Official Passport and Trail Map online, pick one up at any of the Donut Shops, or pick one up at the Visit Butler County, Ohio office. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 class="tip-list__heading">Start Early</h3>
      <p>Please be sure to check each shop’s website or Facebook page for current days and hours of operation while planning your trip. We always recommend starting as early as possible! Please be aware that some donut shops are closed on Sundays and Mondays, and some shops will close for the day once they sell out, even if it’s before their scheduled closing time. Feel free to call ahead while you travel the trail as well. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 class="tip-list__heading">Make It A Weekend</h3>
      <p>The Donut Trail is open for travel and can be completed at your own pace. Keep in mind the trail is self-guided, so you can start and finish wherever you'd like. Visiting 13 Donut Shops in one day can be a bit of a sugar-overload, so many Trailers like to make a road-trip or weekend out of it. We recommend planning for at least two days, but it is possible to complete the Trail in one day with a very early start. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
