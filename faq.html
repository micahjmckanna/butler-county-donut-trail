          <h3 class="faq-list__heading">What is the best Donut Trail route?</h3>
          <p>The sweetest route for you will depend on several things. Your best Donut Trail route will be determined by the day(s) you plan to travel, where you're staying/starting, and what other great Butler County attractions and businesses you
            plan to visit along your journey. If you need any help planning your Donut Trail adventure feel free to give the Butler County Visitors Bureau a call at 513-860-4194.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-list__heading">What are the donut shop hours?</h3>
          <p>Each donut shop on the Donut Trail has varying days of operation and hours. Please be sure to check the shop’s website or Facebook page for current days and hours of operation while planning your trip. Please be aware that some donut
            shops are closed on Sundays and Mondays, and some shops will close for the day once they sell out, even if it’s before their scheduled closing time. Feel free to call ahead and ensure a shop is open as you travel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="faq-list__heading">What if I am missing one passport code because a shop was closed?</h3>
          <p>Passports must be fully completed to be eligible for the T-shirt prize (Oxford Doughnut Shoppe is optional). Each donut shop has varying hours and open days. Please verify the hours of each shop before starting the Donut Trail. Some
            donut shops will close when they sell out. Some shops on the trail have been known to sell out/close by 10AM. Please plan an early start to devour and enjoy the delicious Donut Trail. Feel free to call to call ahead to verify a shop is
            open.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="faq-list__heading">Why do some donut shops sell out so early?</h3>
          <p>Creating and crafting donuts is complex and takes some time. A typical batch of yeast glazed donuts can take 4-5 hours to make. The donut shops are working hard to keep up with the demand of the trail, and appreciate your understanding.
            Feel free to call ahead to verify a shop is open.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            participating donut shop. </p>

        <li>

          <p>Yes, but please plan your route accordingly. Some of the donut shops aren't open seven days per week. Please be sure to check days and hours when planning your route. If you wish to complete the trail in one day we would recommend
